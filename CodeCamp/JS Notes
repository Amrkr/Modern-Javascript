 JavaScript provides seven different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number, and object.
 
 Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. 
 
 Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.
 
 When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined.
 If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". 
 If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a literal string of "undefined".
 
 In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive.
